OpenGL Tutorials, version 0.3.7

This is a series of tutorials on using OpenGL to do graphical rendering.
The code for each tutorial is found in the "Tut *" directories. The code
alone is not enough information to understand what is going on. The actual
documentation is available in several forms.

The HTML form of the documentation can be found by opening the "index.html"
file. There are 3 PDF forms of the documentation. TutorialsComp.pdf is a PDF
that uses very thin margins; it is useful for display on computers (or
tablets). TutorialsPrintBW.pdf is a PDF designed for printing on a black-and-white
printer. TutorialsKindle.pdf is a PDF that is sized specifically for the screen
of the Kindle 2.

The License.txt file contains the licensing information for the materials distributed in these tutorials.
