            thus far. But one of the most important is the treatment of the lighting
            intensity.</p><p>Thus far, we have used light intensity like a color. We clamp it to the range [0, 1].
            We even make sure that combined intensities from different lighting models always are
            within that range.</p><p>What this effectively means is that the light does not brighten the scene. The scene
            without the light is fully lit; our lights simply <span class="emphasis"><em>darken</em></span> parts of
            the scene. They take the diffuse color and make it smaller, because multiplying with a
            number on the range [0, 1] can only ever make a number smaller (or the same).</p><p>This is of course not realistic. In reality, there is no such thing as a
                <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">maximum</span>&#8221;</span> illumination or brightness. There is no such thing as a (1,
            1, 1) light intensity. The actual range of light intensity per wavelength is on the
            range [0, &#8734;). This also means that the range of intensity for reflected light is [0, &#8734;);
            after all, if you shine a really bright light on a surface, it will reflect a lot of it.
            A surface that looks dark blue under dim light can appear light blue under very bright
            light.</p><p>Of course in the real world, things tend to catch on fire if you shine <span class="emphasis"><em>too
                much</em></span> light at them, but that's not something we need to model.</p><p>The concept of lighting darkening a scene was common for a long time in real-time
            applications. It is another part of the reason why, for so many years, 3D games tended
            to avoid the bright outdoors, preferring corridors with darker lighting. The sun is a
            powerful light source; binding lighting intensity to the [0, 1] range does not lead to a
            realistic vision of the outdoors.</p><p>One obvious way to correct this is to take all of the diffuse colors and divide them by
            a value like 2. Then increase your light intensity range from [0, 1] to [0, 2]. This is
            a workable solution, to some extent. Lights can be brighter than 1.0, and lighting can
            serve to increase the brightness of the diffuse color as well as decrease it. Of course,
            2 is just as far from infinity as 1 is, so it is not technically any closer to proper
            lighting. But it is an improvement.</p><p>This technique does have its flaws. As we will see in later tutorials, you often will
            want to render the same object multiple times and combine the results. This method
            does not work when adding contributions from multiple light sources this way, unless you
            limit the sum total of all lights to the same value. Just as we did for diffuse when
            combining it with an ambient term.</p><p>It is certainly possible on modern hardware to model light intensity correctly. And we
            will eventually do that. But these more primitive lighting models do still have their
            uses in some cases. And it is illustrative to see what an improvement having proper
            lighting intensity can make on the result. The lighting computations themselves do not
            change; what changes are the numbers fed into them.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut09 Global Illumination.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Tutorial 09.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut09 In Review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Global Illumination&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;In Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
